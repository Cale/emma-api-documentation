Pagination
==========

Responses with a large number of results should be paginated; the query 
parameters ``start`` and ``end`` can be used to specify how large a set 
of items to retrieve in each call, with a maximum page size of 500. 

Additionally, for any call you can retrieve a count of the results (instead 
of the results themselves) by appending a query parameter of ``count=true``.

So, to pull a large number of results, you start with a count:

  https://api.e2ma.net/123/members?count=true

Then, iterate over the list in blocks of 500:

  https://api.e2ma.net/123/members?start=0&end=500

  https://api.e2ma.net/123/members?start=500&end=1000

Requests for page sizes larger than 500 will limited to ``start`` + 500.

Calls are rate-limited to prevent accidental overuse.  If you exceed the limit
you will receive a response of ``403 Rate Limit Exceeded`` until enough time
has elapsed between calls.
