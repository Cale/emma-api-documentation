Placeholder Syntax
==================

Syntax Overview
---------------

The content of messages can be customized using the template tag library.
Each template tag should be enclosed in a ``[%`` ``%]`` pair. Where a tag
requires a qualifier value, the value should be attached with a colon.

For example, the following extract shows a member's name being inserted into a
greeting::

    Hello [% member:first_name %] [% member:last_name %],

    Welcome to the "Exciting Onions" mailing list, where you can be kept up to
    date on all the latest onion-related news ...

Some tags also accept additional key/value pairs to control their behavior.
For example, adding a default value to a member field::

    Hello [% member:first_name default="Friend" %]

...or specifying the link text for a trackable link::

    Please visit [% link:http://fancyonions.com/home name="our website" %]
