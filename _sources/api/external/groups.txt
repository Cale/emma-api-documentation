Groups
======

With these endpoints, you can manage all aspects of the groups in 
your account. In addition to various CRUD methods, you can also 
use these endpoints to manage the members of your groups. You'll 
want to use these methods if you're managing group membership for 
more than one member at a time. For dealing with single members, 
there are better methods in the ``members`` endpoints.
