Members
=======

In addition to the various CRUD endpoints here related to members, 
you can also change the status of members, including opting them out. 

You'll notice that there are calls related to individual members, but 
we also provide quite a few calls to deal with bulk updates of members. 
Please try to use these whenever possible as opposed to looping through 
a list of members and calling the individual member calls. 

Where this is especially important is when adding new members. To do a bulk 
import, you'll POST to the ``/#account_id/members`` endpoint. In return, 
you'll receive an import ID. You can use this ID to check the status and 
results of your import. Imports are generally pretty fast, but the time 
to completion can vary with greater system usage.
