Fields
======

These endpoints let you create, edit, update and delete all of the custom 
fields in your account. Of particular interest is the 
``/#account_id/fields/#field_id/clear`` endpoint which lets you clear out 
all the data in a single field for all members in your account. This makes 
it easy to re-initialize a dataset if you're looking to correct an import 
error or syncing issue.
